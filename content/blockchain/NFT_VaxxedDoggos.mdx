[JomaTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKO9UjSeLew) aka Joma/Jonathan Ma is a fairly well-known YouTuber who brought
tech videos on another whole creative level.
He worked at many big companies like Google, Facebook and BuzzFeed and is known for his satirical videos about
life in tech (Data Science), his big love for Black Pink, filmmaking and huge collection of stuffed Doggos (Shiba & Doge).

With currently [1.57M](https://www.youtube.com/c/jomaoppa) subscribers on Youtube and Joma just announced his first NFT collection: [VaxxedDoggos](https://www.vaxxeddoggos.com)
and I believe those doggos will be a very interesting and promising project in the content creator and blockchain space.

# **NFT project details**

- VaxxedDoggos, 2500 half corgis/shibas drawn by Joma
- acts as a funding for Joma's short films & content
- Solana Blockchain, minting price 0.88 SOL (~$100)
- public sale with Whitelist (1200)
- launch on 1st February 2022
- [whitepaper available](https://vaxxed-doggo-assets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Vaxxed+Doggos+Whitepaper.pdf)

Right now there still are around **200 Whitelist spots** (30th January 2021) free until launch (1st February) and Joma is hosting a lot of giveaways on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vaxxeddoggos). I recommend to follow and participate!

Joma also initiated a very successful [auction](https://www.magiceden.io/auction/vaxxed_doggo) for Lunar New Year and raised **69.69 SOL ($6.350)** to a non-profit organization called "**Asians fighting Injustice**".



# **What makes this project promising?**

I believe Joma will be one of the first successful and serious tech content creator who is creating his own non-simping NFT collection with a clear goal and vision:
> **building the ["Joma Media Lab"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9JFitrgGgs&t=354s) and funding his film directing.**

I genuinely believe someone who worked at FANG companies always comes with a high level of execution, discipline and desire pursuing and fulfilling their dreams.
After watching Joma's videos for more than 2 years already I could follow his journey and development from a  data scientist to a software engineer, entertainer and most importantly as a film maker.


And after all those endless hours watching his videos, I can tell he never stopped evolving - just like Son-Goku. Every new video feels like another power level regarding creativity and his understanding for his viewership and YT-algorithm.
Working as a Data Scientist and Analyst comes with some useful skills - as you can see the successful growth of Joma's YouTube channel in the graph down below.

![youtube analytics](../imgs/joma-yt-analytics.jpg "Consistent growth on YouTube (Source: https://socialblade.com/youtube/c/jomaoppa/monthly)")

When you think he couldn't do it better, he hires a whole movie making team and creates his own little [short movies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ZcmboYbNPQ&t=1s) in the Joma Universe.
The quality and effort put into the videos is increasing with every single video.

# Key factors
There are a couple of reason why I believe in this project. Let me break it down to you.

**Proven history**:
I think Joma's ultimate ability is the understanding of and execution on big data. As an ex-Data Scientist and ex-FANG or just simply being a smart doggo, I think Joma has a clear understanding of algorithms on Social Media platforms and knows what content his audience wants to see. Supply and demand. His immense YouTube growth in the last few months clearly confirms it.

**Active community**:
The community comes from Joma's social media channels. It means most of them already know and (hopefully) want to support him. As a fellow viewer, you kinda build a one-sided relation towards Joma (if you like his content).
That increases the value and demand of this project: an existing and engaging audience. Joma also is actively engaging with the members on the Discord Server and Twitter Space considering suggestions and opinions.

**Completely doxxed**:
Doxxed NFT creators are always a good indicator of a successful project in the NFT space. As a famous YouTuber, Joma already doxxed himself by revealing his identy to the www. That means you can dig into Joma's history & past performance learning about what he has done. The good and the bad. Also, Joma's dream is to create his first own big movie, this is why he needs to take care of his reputation. Anything negative could affect his YouTube channels or this NFT project. That's why I believe he will consistently put in effort into his projects to create positive impact - as long as NFTs will be accepted from the public.

**Clear roadmap**:
Not every NFT project needs utility or any kind of merch or roadmap but having one brings more fun, excitement and engagement on the table.
In this case, its more about supporting a fellow content creator who understands todays trends, technologies and creates educational, wholesome and entertaining videos and short movies about it.
Joma offers some priviliges by joining his VaxxedDoggos like access to a private discord channel, to be an extra in his videos or early access to his youtube videos and more. And who knows? Maybe there will be some merch as well. A stuffed or framed VaxxedDoggo would be nice actually.

**Status Symbol**:
Another and maybe even the most important factor is that Joma joined the [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://opensea.io/collection/boredapeyachtclub) - the most popular NFT collections in the world with the highest Floor Price to date: 100 ETH (29.01.2022). Joining this club comes with a big statement. [Justin Bieber](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/3001) also just joined the BAYC for 500 ETH.

I believe it's an important move Joma does, which could be translated into the following:
  >*I am investing more than ~$200k (51.96ETH) on one NFT to tell the world I am serious about the NFT space. I want to access a community with other like-minded individuals who believe in the blockchain. That's why I am building my own.*.

![BAYC#2828](../imgs/joma-ape2828.jpg "Consistent growth on YouTube (Source: https://socialblade.com/youtube/c/jomaoppa/monthly)")

On November 17th 2021, Joma became an ape: [BAYC#2828](https://opensea.io/assets/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/2828) for 51.96ETH.
Just to give you some reference, there are otherpopular celebrities who also are part of the BAYC project: Eminem, Shaquille Oâ€™Neal, Gary Vaynerchuk, Steve Aoki, Paris Hilton, Justin Bieber and many [more](https://boardroom.tv/bored-ape-nft-celebrity-owners/#:~:text=Celebrities%20from%20around%20the%20world,show%20off%20their%20new%20purchases.&text=Get%20on%20our%20list%20for,trends%2C%20interviews%2C%20and%20more.).

# Conclusion

Since Joma will be the essential foundation and main factor controlling the quality, branding and literally marketing of those digital assets (NFTs) himself, the values of the NFTs will change (de-/increase) depending on what Joma achieves himself.

That's what I believe and that's the reason why I love content creation so much. You are in control of what, how and when - your own reputation and personal branding as a content creator.

I am convinced that the value of the NFTs will proportionally grow with Joma's networth itself. And guess what? Joma quit his job as Google to become a full time content creator (probably) or... a crypto millionaire, we will see. I think we can expect more high quality content from Joma in the future - especially around cryptocurrencies and blockchain.
If you haven't watched, check out Joma's recent YouTube video on [Crypto Trading: Expectation vs Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCqkVZVPOe8).

With the active and engaging community Joma built on YouTube I assume many people will take this opportunity and support Joma achieving his own goals.
It's like Gary Vee wrote in his book: Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook. *You give, give, give and then ask.* I feel like Joma has given me so much thanks to his educational, entertaining and inspirational videos that I feel guilty not supporting him if I have the chance to do so.
And I think many other's feel the same way. We want to help him creating educational videos about crypto and blockchain without relying on external sponsorships. Simply because we enjoy what he does.
By acquiring one of the VaxxedDoggos NFTs you actively decide to support Joma. That's why I want to do. I want to support.

Public minting starts on 1st February. Will you join?
