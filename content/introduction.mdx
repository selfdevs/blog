This site is a collection of thoughts, ideas and slices of life written by the members of the [self.dev community](https://selfdev.app).
We mainly write about topics which improve everyone's **self-development** like decision-making, mentality, productivity
and also about more technical fields like blockchain, trading or computer science.
