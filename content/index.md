This site is a collection of thoughts, ideas and slices of life written by the members of the [self.dev community](https://selfdev.app).
We mainly write about topics which improve everyone's **self-development** like decision-making, mentality, productivity
and also about more technical fields like career, computer science, app dev, web dev or big data and AI.

In general, we hope to contribute to a world where cross-disciplinary collaborations are the new meta.

We believe that individuals from different backgrounds helping each other will lead to the most successful and efficient result.
We are passionated about creating a wholesome and genuine community where everybody wants to contributed in a self-driven and kind way.
